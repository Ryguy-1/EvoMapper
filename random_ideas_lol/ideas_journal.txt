first off, i could make it so that you have a library like librosa find the onsets in the song, create randomly placed notes at those places,
and have it evolve from there. another option is to somehow train another network to produce a mapping from a song which would be pretty dang cool
already. In other words, it would basically be just a generator trained on a song input to produce a good mapping. i could train this network on 
sections of a song at a time and spend a lot of time making sure the beat stuff all lines up which would be really cool but really hard also.
I may just start off by making a program to place logical-ish (this can be like the basic idea) notes at onsets and then have it mutate according
to the discriminator (really just like a fine-tuning I suppose??? who really knows). it could turn out pretty cool though!
